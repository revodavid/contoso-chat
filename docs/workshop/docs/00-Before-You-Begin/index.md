1. (recommended) Familiarity with Visual Studio Code. 
   * We will run all code in GitHub Codespaces, a virtualized Linux machine, instead of your local laptop. We won't be running anything on your laptop directly.
   * VS Code Online will be our development environment in GitHub Codespaces.
   * If you are familiar with running Codespaces within VS Code Desktop on your laptop, feel free to do so.

## What You Learn

In this hands-on workshop, you will learn to use the Azure AI platform for code-first development of custom copilot solutions:
* **Infrastructure**: Simplified provisioning and deployment with Azure Developer CLI
* **Ideation**: Rapid prototyping with Prompty asset and Azure AI model deployments
* **Evaluation**: Manual and AI-assisted testing with custom evaluators (for quality, safety)
* **Operationalization**: Deployment using Azure Container Apps (next: monitoring & actions)
* **Customization**: adapt to your application needs (data, prompts, models, evaluators)

The workshop is designed for delivery in two formats:

 - **Tour-guided** where you join an instructor-led session (e.g., on Microsoft AI Tour)
 - **Self-guided** where you walk through instructions on your own (e.g., at home)

## Tour-Guided Version

- [X] You will be provided with an Azure subscription (just bring your laptop)
- [X] The infrastructure will be pre-provisioned for you to save you time (just launch lab VM)
- [X] You will have a fixed time (**75 minutes**) to complete the workshop (in venue)
